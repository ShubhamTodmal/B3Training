    // here flightno = flight this happend when function call but after flightno assigned to new value
    console.log(shubh);//here we see as primitive it not worked as expected here we see changing in value
    //it happed cause as we know if we create a copy of object it create same memory in heap hence change in one var halt to other too
    // so here pass = shubh this happed when function call then as pass.name changed it also reflected in shubh

    //lets check if we change passport no
    const newpass = function(person){
        person.passport = Math.trunc(Math.random()*100000);
    }//here new passport value evaluated

    newpass(shubh);//here shubh passport's new value created
    checkIn(flight,shubh);//here again chek in call for new shubh.passport value
    // here we got else is printing cause passport value not matched.cause as changed in copy of object also change the real object

    
    //Passing by value and reference

    // in JS there is no pass by reference even it look liked paas by reference
    //cause even when we pass a reference it actual have a value and create a new memory so even refrenced is passed in reality it passed a value of that reference contain
