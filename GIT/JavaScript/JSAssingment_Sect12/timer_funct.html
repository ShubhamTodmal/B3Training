// ******************       set time out        **************************
        setTimeout(()=>console.log('hiii'),3000);//here hii print after 3 sec but its a arrow function and it not run by us so we cant pass para to it so for that we have to pass it with timeout function like below
        setTimeout((a,b) => console.log(a,b),3000,'hii','shubham');//soo as para increase we pass it in settime function too
        
        //we can stop timer to
        const data =['hii','s']
        const greet = setTimeout((a,b) => console.log(a,b),3000,...data);
        if(data.includes('shubham')) clearTimeout(greet);//here even after 3 sec it not printed
        //lets try without shubham//and it run

        //lets try it on project for loan approval

// ***************      set interval        ******************************
        //it actaully run again and again for given time
        setInterval(function() {
            const now = new Date();
            console.log(now);
        }, 1000);//here we see for every 1 sec the date is rpinting

        //using above info lets try to implement logout timer in a project
